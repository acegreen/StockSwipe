# StockSwipe #

Don't find a gold digger, find a gold miner. And instead of begging for a date, find a 10 bagger trade!!
Lets swipe through stock cards and discover trade ideas in seconds. 

###  So what is StockSwipe? ### 

The idea came to us as we were searching for trades ourselves. Part of our daily routine was to scan FinViz and other sites for charts with a potential trade opportunities. But none of these sites had an intuitive way to do so on mobile. Thats when it hit us! The simplistic UI makes it a perfect fit for a finance app on a mobile device.

###  Main Features: ### 

CardView: Did someone say: It’s like Tinder for Stocks? 
Well don't know about that! One helps you make money, the other helps you find someone who will take it away :D Though we do share similarities, like a beautiful 3 cards view which will make discovering stocks easier than ever. Best part: its not “suggested” based on others bias. These are randomly selected and we want you to be your own judge. If you think you found a great trade idea you can swipe right to mark it as a long or left to mark it as a short or swipe up to skip to the next card.

###  MarketView: Trending cloud, top stories and ticker board ### 

With MarketView, you get a great overview of the market, with trending stocks, top stories and a ticker board. The trending cloud is a clever twist to just listing trending stocks. We wanted to highlight stocks that are trending in a fun way. And here size matters..The bigger, the better! haha. No but really, the bigger, the more trending a stock is. This is based on how much its mentioned on social media.
